# WebWatchdog-AI Powered Website Analyzer

## Overview

This application empowers users to gain insightful analysis of any website using an AI model (Mistral). It extracts key information about the product or service offered, including the problem it solves, the solution provided, target audience, and potential use cases. Users can then interact with an AI chatbot to delve deeper into the analysis or ask further questions about the website's content.
